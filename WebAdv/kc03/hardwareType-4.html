    	 <p>
		Hardware devices are grouped into several categories. They can either be integral to the computer (such as a motherboard) or attached to it via cables, Wi-Fi, or Bluetooth. Hardware devices that aren’t an integral part of the main computer unit, such as keyboards, mice, screens, printers, and scanners are called peripherals.
		</p> 
		<p>
		Mobile phones and tablets usually have integrated hardware devices and don’t need peripherals. Here are some common hardware devices.
		</p>
		<li>
		 Processing devices

		These devices take data and instructions to produce new variations of data.Computers may also have specialized
		processing devices that deal with graphics or audio and video signals.

		<li>
		  Input devices

		<li>
		Output devices
		</li>
		<p>

		These devices take data from the computer and present it to the user. Newer output devices include virtual reality (VR) goggles that immerse users in a 3D world.

		<li>
		Storage devices
