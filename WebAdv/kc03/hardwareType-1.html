 Types of hardware device
 </h1>
 <p>
Hardware devices are grouped into several categories. They can either be integral to the computer (such as a motherboard) or attached to it via cables, Wi-Fi, or Bluetooth. Hardware devices that aren’t an integral part of the main computer unit, such as keyboards, mice, screens, printers, and scanners are called peripherals.
