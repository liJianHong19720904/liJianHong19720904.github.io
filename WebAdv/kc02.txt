5.reading
<img src=pad.jpg>When talking about computers, people often refer to hardware,particularly in terms of upgrading or replacing it. Hardware combines with software to form a usable computing system.
  The physical parts of a computer are called hardware. These include things we can see, such as the monitor and computer case, as well as things we can’t see, such as the motherboard and microprocessor inside the computer case.
 Things like programs, the operating system, and firmware (a type of program that is embedded into the microprocessor) are called software. They allow users to access the capabilities of the hardware.
 <img src=hardware.jpg>Hardware is everything in, or connected to, a computer that’s part of the physical world and can be touched. This includes the computer itself, with a screen, keyboard, and mouse. It also includes devices connected to a computer, such as speakers and memory cards. The computer’s internal components are considered hardware as well.
