 Learn Software Architecture with CSS Box Model（准备篇：学习计算机软件体系，实践CSS盒状模型）
2.introduction
 能理解计算机的软件的大致分类，基本可以分为2类：操作系统 operating system (OS)和应用软件 applications。能对学习生活中的各类软件阐述分析，并能对常用操作系统平台和应用加以区分，并能实现一些基本操作。
 在Web编程实践中，学习CSS语言，练习对Web页元素的颜色值、padding、border、margin等通用外观特征进行控制。

An operating system (OS) is a piece of software that manages a computer’s hardware and software resources, and makes it easier for us to use them. There are many types of OS, and they can be used for different purposes.There are many operating systems available. Microsoft Windows and Linux are the most commonly used ones. Apple machines use a specific operating system, called macOS.

<img src=dos.jpg> One year earlier, 1975 ， Bill Gates and Paul Allen had founded Microsoft, developing operating system software that allowed users to interact with various personal  computers.

A computer operating system manages a computer’s resources, such as its disk space, memory, and peripherals. The OS can be thought of as an intermediary between the computer’s hardware and its software. It receives instructions from applications,  peripherals, and the hard drive, and carries out these instructions on software, the hard drive, and other peripherals.

 <img src=app.jpg> An application is a type of software that allows its user to perform a specific task. The OS provides a framework for these applications to run. Application software is designed to complete specific tasks on a computer. Some of these are paid, as either a one-off purchase or a monthly subscription. Others may be free to download and use. A lot of free software is also open source, which enables users to see and modify the application’s code.

The operating system uses applications called  utilities, which allow users to manage their computer, its devices, and its programs. There are many different utility programs, and they vary across operating systems. Users can access these via a special menu or control panel.

<img src=cssBoxModel.jpg> As we’ve seen, every element in a document, both block-level and inline, generates a rectangular element box. The components of an element box are diagrammed in the figure (click the button) .   

<img src=cssBoxModel.jpg> Content area . At the core of the element box is the content itself. In the figure, the content area is indicated by a white box. 
<img src=cssBoxModel.jpg> Inner edges . The edges of the content area are referred to as the inner edges of the element box. Although the inner edges are made distinct by a color change in the figure (click the button), in real pages, the edge of the content area is invisible.
<img src=cssBoxModel.jpg> Padding . The padding is the area between the content area and an optional border. In the diagram, the padding area is indicated by a yellow-orange color. Padding is optional.
<img src=cssBoxModel.jpg>  Border . The border is a line (or stylized line) that surrounds the element and its padding. Borders are also optional.
<img src=cssBoxModel.jpg>  Margin . The margin is an optional amount of space added on the outside of the border. In the diagram, the margin is indicated with light-blue shading, but in reality, margins are always transparent, allowing the background of the parent element to show through. 
<img src=cssBoxModel.jpg> Outer edge . The outside edges of the margin area make up the outer edges of the element box. This is the total area the element takes up on the page, and it includes the width of the content area plus the total amount of padding, border, and margins applied to the element. The outer edge in the diagram is indicated with a dotted line, but in real web pages, the edge of the margin is invisible.
<img src=cssBoxModel.jpg>All elements have these box components; however, as you will see, some properties behave differently based on whether the element is block or inline. In fact, we’ll see some of those differences right away as we look at box dimensions. By default, the width and height of a block element are calculated automatically by the browser (thus the default auto value). The box will be as wide as the browser window or other containing block element, and as tall as necessary to fit the content. However, you can use the width and height properties to make the content area of an element a specific width or height.
