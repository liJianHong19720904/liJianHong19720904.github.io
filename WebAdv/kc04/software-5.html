		An operating system (OS) is a piece of software that manages a computer’s hardware and software resources, and makes it easier for us to use them. There are many types of OS, and they can be used for different purposes. 
		</p> 
		<p>
		A computer operating system manages a computer’s resources, such as its disk space, memory, and peripherals. The OS can be thought of as an intermediary between the computer’s hardware and its software. It receives instructions from applications,  peripherals, and the hard drive, and carries out these instructions on software, the hard drive, and other peripherals.
		</p>
		<p>
		An application is a type of software that allows its user to perform a specific task. The OS provides a framework for these applications to run. 
		</p>
		<p>
		The operating system uses applications called  utilities, which allow users to manage their computer, its devices, and its programs. There are many different utility programs, and they vary across operating systems. Users can access these via a special menu or control panel.
