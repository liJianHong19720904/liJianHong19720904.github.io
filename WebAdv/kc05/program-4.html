 Programming
 </h1>
 <p class = "odd" >
Computers are about as common as screwdrivers today, but they are quite a bit more complex, and making them do what you want them to do isn’t always easy.
</p>
 <p class = "even" >
If the task you have for your computer is a common, well-understood one, such as showing you your email or acting like a calculator, you can open the appropriate application and get to work. But for unique or open-ended tasks, there probably is no application.
</p>
 <p class = "odd" >
That is where programming may come in. Programming is the act of constructing a program——a set of precise instructions telling a computer what to do.
</p>
 <p class = "even" >
Because computers are dumb, pedantic beasts, programming is fundamentally tedious and frustrating. Fortunately, if you can get over that fact, and maybe even enjoy the rigor of thinking in terms that dumb machines can deal with,  programming can be rewarding.
</p>
 <p class = "odd" >
It allows you to do things in seconds that would take forever by hand. It is a way to make your computer tool do things that it couldn’t do before. And it provides a wonderful exercise in abstract thinking.
