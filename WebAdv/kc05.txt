 Programming（编程）
2.introduction
 理解编程对使用计算机的意义。对于简单地利用计算机，可以使用现成的软件，而对于个性化或开放的计算机应用的需求，我们必须编制程序，学习编程的意义也在于此。可以说，廉价的现代计算机，以其强大计算能力，结合人类的抽象思维能力，可为每一个人提供了数字化发展机会和巨大的潜力。
 在本课的Web代码实践中，新增了CSS对类的设计，逐步实现Web元素的盒装模型的padding、border、margin的综合使用。

5.reading
 Programming .   Computers are about as common as screwdrivers today, but they are quite a bit more complex, and making them do what you want them to do isn’t always easy.

If the task you have for your computer is a common, well-understood one, such as showing you your email or acting like a calculator, you can open the appropriate application and get to work. But for unique or open-ended tasks, there probably is no application.
That is where programming may come in. Programming is the act of constructing a program——a set of precise instructions telling a computer what to do.

Because computers are dumb, pedantic beasts, programming is fundamentally tedious and frustrating. Fortunately, if you can get over that fact, and maybe even enjoy the rigor of thinking in terms that dumb machines can deal with,  programming can be rewarding.

It allows you to do things in seconds that would take forever by hand. It is a way to make your computer tool do things that it couldn’t do before. And it provides a wonderful exercise in abstract thinking.
