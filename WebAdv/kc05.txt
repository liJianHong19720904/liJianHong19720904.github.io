 About Programming（准备篇：编程概述）
2.introduction
 理解编程是深刻地使用计算机，具有重大意义。简单地利用计算机可以使用现成的软件，而对于个性化或一些开放性计算机应用的问题，则需要我们理解需求，编制程序，学习编程的本质上就是分析问题和用高效率的计算机解决问题。当代廉价的现代计算机，配合其强大计算能力，再结合人类的抽象思维能力，可为每一个人提供了数字化发展机会和带来巨大的潜力。
 在本课的Web代码实践中，新增了CSS对类的设计，逐步实现Web元素的盒装模型的padding、border、margin的综合使用。

5.reading
 Programming .   Computers are about as common as screwdrivers today, but they are quite a bit more complex, and making them do what you want them to do isn’t always easy.

If the task you have for your computer is a common, well-understood one, such as showing you your email or acting like a calculator, you can open the appropriate application and get to work. But for unique or open-ended tasks, there probably is no application.
That is where programming may come in. Programming is the act of constructing a program——a set of precise instructions telling a computer what to do.

Because computers are dumb, pedantic beasts, programming is fundamentally tedious and frustrating. Fortunately, if you can get over that fact, and maybe even enjoy the rigor of thinking in terms that dumb machines can deal with,  programming can be rewarding.

It allows you to do things in seconds that would take forever by hand. It is a way to make your computer tool do things that it couldn’t do before. And it provides a wonderful exercise in abstract thinking.
