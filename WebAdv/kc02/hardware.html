particularly in terms of upgrading or replacing it. Hardware

Hardware is everything in, or connected to, a computer that’s part
of the physical world and can be touched. This includes the computer
itself, with a screen, keyboard, and mouse. It also includes devices
connected to a computer, such as speakers and memory cards. The
computer’s internal components are considered hardware as well.
